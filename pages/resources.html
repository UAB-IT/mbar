      Scientific Advisory Committee meets monthly to review these data
      access forms. After review, and scientific advisory committee

      Note: There are just over 200 participants’ data in this
      dataset, and thousands of data elements per participant. Not all
      participants have data for each of the data elements. For
      example, some participants moved too much in the scanner to
      acquire their BOLD fMRI, and so do not have that data. If you
      would like to know the number of participants who have usable
      data for a given set of data elements, please email
      pstew@uab.edu and our team will work with you to find out how
      many data points are available.

      <strong>Types of data:</strong> These datasets involve many
      types of data. Keep in mind that Raw data will need to be
      processed. In particular, frozen blood samples are stored at our
      University of Florida site, and in order to analyze and process
      those data, you will need to thaw it. Because blood samples are
      finite, we will combine proposals which require access to blood
      in order minimize the number of times that samples must be
      thawed.

          to the data, to prepare for a set of typical data analyses.
          For example, skull stripping, identification of white matter
