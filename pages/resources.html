      the Manual of Procedures, so that if there is a question about
      how a particular type of data was collected, you can query the

      <strong>How to access data:</strong> Members of the MBRF
      research Institutes can access the data for testing hypotheses
      for new publications or preliminary data for grant proposals. To
      do so, complete this

        class="font-semibold leading-7 text-blue-600"
        >Data Access Form</a

      your analyses (using language as used in the Data List and Data
      Dictionary). Email this Data Access form to

        class="font-semibold leading-7 text-blue-600"
        >pstew@uab.edu</a
      >, with Subject line “MBAR data access form.” The MBAR
      Scientific Advisory Committee meets monthly to review these data
      access forms. After review, and scientific advisory committee
      approval, our team will collate the datasets needed for the
      proposal to be shared with you on the Box platform.

      Note: There are just over 200 participants’ data in this
      dataset, and thousands of data elements per participant. Not all
      participants have data for each of the data elements. For
      example, some participants moved too much in the scanner to
      acquire their BOLD fMRI, and so do not have that data. If you
      would like to know the number of participants who have usable
      data for a given set of data elements, please email
      pstew@uab.edu, and our team will work with you to find out how
      many data points are available.
