<p>The McKnight Brain Aging Registry is a collaborative enterprise including investigators from 4 institutions (UAB, University of Florida, University of Arizona, University of Miami), and is funded by the <a href="https://www.uab.edu/medicine/mbi/">McKnight Brain Institute</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have worked together to create a large database of information about how the brain successfully ages. Members of the McKnight Brain Research Foundation sites who would like to learn more about the project, what datasets are available, and how to access them, should see this <a href="http://go.uab.edu/mbar">website</a>.</p>

<li>These data have allowed us to examine whether a common cognitive batttery, the "NIH toolbox cognitive battery" is valid in the oldest old. We find, in this paper, that NIH toolbox is overall valid, but executive function measures relate to a range of cognitive constructs -- consistent with age-related dedifferentiation in this cohort. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36239453/">Nolin et al, 2022, Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society</a></li>

<li>We have examined the brain's network architecture in these older adults to show that the brain's 'segregation' predicts processing speed, independent of any evidence for disease. This is a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.05.463207v4">pre-print under review.</a></li>
