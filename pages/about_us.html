      About Us
    </h1>
      
      
<p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">The McKnight Brain Aging Registry is a collaborative enterprise including investigators from 4 institutions (UAB, University of Florida, University of Arizona, University of Miami), and is funded by the <a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/">McKnight Brain Research Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">We have worked together to create a large database of information about how the brain successfully ages. Members of the McKnight Brain Research Foundation sites who would like to learn more about the project, what datasets are available, and how to access them, should see this <a href="http://go.uab.edu/mbar">website</a>.</p>
