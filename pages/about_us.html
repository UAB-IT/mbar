<p>The McKnight Brain Aging Registry is a collaborative enterprise including investigators from 4 institutions (UAB, University of Florida, University of Arizona, University of Miami), and is funded by the <a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/">McKnight Brain Research Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have worked together to create a large database of information about how the brain successfully ages. Members of the McKnight Brain Research Foundation sites who would like to learn more about the project, what datasets are available, and how to access them, should see this <a href="http://go.uab.edu/mbar">website</a>.</p>

      The foundation's strategic pillars emphasize leadership in
      establishing dedicated research on cognitive decline, inspiring
      public knowledge and maintaining cognitive health, and fostering
      strong partnerships with key scientific and academic bodies.
      These collaborations have led to significant advancements,
      including the establishment of endowed chairs in honor of Evelyn
      McKnight at various institutes, aimed at driving research in
      neurology and the neurobiology of learning and memory.

      The McKnight Brain Institutes, integral components of the
      foundationâ€™s efforts, are hubs of multidisciplinary research
      aimed at understanding cognitive aging and developing
      interventions to maintain and enhance cognitive function. These
      institutes, located at the universities of Alabama, Arizona,
      Florida, and Miami, bring together leading researchers to
      explore and address the neurobiological bases of memory and
      aging, supported by cutting-edge facilities and collaborative
      networks that enrich the field of cognitive neuroscience.
